# InsurUs

InsurUs is a website dedicated to bridging the gap between insurance agencies and new customers.

# Purpose

Our website seeks to inform, educate, and aid teens and young adults in hopes of making an easy transition into the financial world of insurance. Often times, many insurance seekers find their rates to be astronomically high compared to what is typically advertised. Not only do we aim to help clear all misconceptions, but we hope to help them reduce their rates as soon as possible through a seamless transition.
